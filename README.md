# Component Library Project
 Hello guys this is my component library. From my component library if any user want to copy the style of my components then user can just click copy button and paste the code in his html file.

## Installation
but before that user has to copy and paste my css file link in his head section of the html. That css file link is provided in the installation section of the website and also provided on the documentation page. Or copy the code given below in your html head tag. 

``` <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://easywebdev.netlify.app/components.css">```
## Review the code
Now for anybody who want to review my code of component library. 
I know its difficult to find out how the files are working in the project and what is the entry point and how to view the code efficiently and easily and in less time. Then you can view the file structure below that will help you and also if you find any issues with the code, you are most welcome to review my code and correct my mistakes.

There are 
1. three html files in my component library (index.html, components.html, about.html)
2. three css files (style.css, blockcomponents.css, components.css)
3. two folders (images, ComponentsCss)
4. two JavaScript files(script.js, components.js)

Now index.html, style.css and script.js consists of the main(documentation) page of the component library
